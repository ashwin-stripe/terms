<section>

This addendum to the [Stripe Services Agreement](/legal) constitutes a legal agreement (referred to below as the &quot;Terms&quot;) between you, Stripe, and NAB Australia Bank Limited (&quot;NAB&quot;).

These Terms provide additional terms applicable to the Payment Services provided under the Stripe Services Agreement. **You must accept all of the terms and conditions of these Terms to use the Payment Services provided by Stripe via NAB.  To the extent applicable to you, these Terms also govern the use of the FX Payment Service that is provided directly by NAB.**

When your customer pays you by using the Payment Services, he or she has the option of paying you through a funding source offered on the Stripe website including a Card Scheme funded payment.  Since you may be the recipient of a Card Scheme funded payment, you are required to enter into a direct contractual relationship with a bank that is a member of the Card Schemes.  However, by using the Payment Services, you are not establishing a depository or other account with NAB.  NAB is not responsible for the provision of any services by Stripe or your use of the services for your business.  NAB is also not responsible for providing customer service to you to resolve any issues you may have related to your use of the Payment Services.  You are solely responsible for providing support to your customers for all issues related to your products and services.

(m)	must not unfairly distinguish between issuers of a Card when accepting a transaction; and

(n)	must not refuse to complete a transaction solely because a Cardholder refuses to provide additional identification information in circumstances where you do not legitimately require that information and NAB does not require You to obtain it; and

(o)	if You collect or store Cardholder information, You must comply with any Data Security Standards notified to You; and

(p)	You must not transfer or attempt to transfer financial liability under these Terms by asking or requiring a Cardholder to waive his or her dispute rights; and

(b)	notify Stripe if You become aware of or suspect fraud on the part of a Cardholder; and

(d)	establish a fair policy for dealing with refunds and disputes about transactions and include information about that policy on Transaction Receipts as required by Stripe; and

(e)	only submit a transaction as a refund to a Cardholder if it is a genuine refund of a previous sale transaction. The refund must be processed to the same Card that was used in the original sales transaction and be for the original sale amount or, if the Cardholder has agreed to a partial refund, the amount of that partial refund; and

(f)	give refunds for transactions by means of credit and not in cash or cheque; and

(g)	if a transaction for a sale does not cover the full amount of the sale: (i) in the situation in which the Card is used to make a deposit or pay an instalment, You may accept the Card in payment of all or part of the outstanding balance; and (ii) in any other circumstance, You must obtain the balance due at the time the sale is completed in cash; and  

(h)	not state or set a minimum or maximum amount for a Card transaction without our prior written consent; and

(i)	not ask a Cardholder to reveal their PIN or any other secret identifier; and

### 6. Card Network Disclosure

The NAB mailing address is National Australia Bank, 800 Bourke St, Docklands, Victoria and its phone number is 13 22 65. NAB discloses that: (a) it is the only entity approved to extend acceptance of Visa and MasterCard products directly to you; (b) it must be a principal to these Terms; (c) it is responsible for educating you on pertinent Visa and MasterCard rules with which you must comply, but this information may be provided to you by Stripe; (d) it is responsible for and must provide settlement funds to Stripe; and (e) it is responsible for all funds held in reserve that are derived from foreign currency settlement.

### 7.        FX Payment Service

7.1        If you have selected to apply, and have been approved by NAB, to receive the FX Payment Service in respect of one or more Covered Currencies, you may offer your goods or services to be paid for in that Covered Currency or Covered Currencies on your website.

7.2        All card transaction amounts that are processed under the FX Payment Service will be automatically converted into Australian dollars (AUD) by NAB at a time and exchange rate determined by NAB and not by Stripe.

7.3        The FX Payment Service is provided by NAB, subject to the following terms:

(a)	the exchange rate used in the conversion of Covered Currency transaction amounts into AUD will be the rate that applies at the time that the currency exchange is booked by NAB, which may be up to two business days after the day that the card transaction was processed in the Covered Currency; 

(b)	the conversion rate used by NAB to convert the Covered Currency to Australian dollars will be sourced from the traded “Reuters D2” offer rate at the time of booking the conversion and will include a margin to NAB. The margin at the time of preparation of this document is 1.8%. NAB may vary the margin upon 30 days notice to you, which may be provided via Stripe; 

(c)	while NAB publishes daily indicative exchange rates on its website, the rates applicable to the FX Payment Service may differ from this rate; 

(d)	NAB will determine the actual time at which it will perform the exchange between the Covered Currency and Australian dollar; 

(e)	Stripe will notify you of the fees and charges relating to the FX Payment Service from time to time; and 

(f)	Covered Currency transactions will be processed and settlement amounts will be paid to you in accordance with the Stripe Services Agreement.

7.4        You acknowledge and understand that because NAB will determine the actual time when it will perform the currency exchange, the rate of exchange may have changed from the time when your customer made the payment in the Covered Currency to the time when it is exchanged to Australian dollars. The amount you will receive in Australian dollars may therefore be greater or less than the amount you would have received if the exchange had occurred at the time of customer&#39;s purchase.

7.5        If a transaction for which the proceeds were converted to AUD using the FX Payment Service is subsequently Chargedback or refunded, the Chargedback or refunded amount will be re-converted into the currency associated with the original charge using the FX Payment Service. The rate at which this re-conversion happens may be different from the rate applicable to the original conversion.

### 8. Invalid or Unacceptable Transactions

8.1        A transaction is not valid if:

(a)	the transaction is illegal as per applicable laws; or

(b)	if applicable, the signature on the voucher, Transaction Receipt or authority is forged or unauthorised; or

(d)	You have been told not to accept the Card; or

(e)	the transaction is not authorised by the Cardholder; or

(h)	another person has provided or is to provide the goods or services that are the subject of the transaction to a Cardholder; or

(i)	You did not actually supply the goods or services to a genuine Cardholder as required by the terms of the transaction, or have indicated Your intention not to do so; or

(c) without limiting the above, delay, block, freeze or refuse to accept any transaction where NAB has reasonable grounds to believe that the transaction breaches Australian law or sanctions or the laws or sanctions of any other country.
