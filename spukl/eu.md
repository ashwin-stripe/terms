These terms create an agreement between you and Stripe Payments UK, Ltd. ("SPUKL"). Capitalised terms used in this agreement but not defined have the meanings given in the [Services Agreement](https://www.stripe.com/legal).

SPUKL is authorised as an [electronic money institution]( https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_FirmDetailsPage?id=001b000000pibOHAAY) by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority to issue electronic money, perform cash placement and cash withdrawal services on payment accounts, execute payment transactions, make money remittances, and acquire payment transactions (the "Authorised Payment Services"). You authorise SPUKL to perform the Authorised Payment Services in connection with your use of the Services and in connection with the payment methods and services provided to you by other Financial Services Providers. 

These terms apply as between you and SPUKL with respect to the services that SPUKL provides to you in its role as a Financial Services Provider under the Services Agreement. These terms incorporate, by reference, the terms of the Agreement, except that in each case "Stripe" will be deemed to be a reference to SPUKL, and the application of the incorporated terms will be limited to SPUKLâ€™s provision of the Authorised Payment Services. 

Please note that all other parts of the Services will remain governed by the Agreement between you and Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd.
