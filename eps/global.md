# EPS (E-PAYMENT STANDARD)
</header>
<section>

[eps](https://www.eps-ueberweisung.at) is a payment method that allows for immediate online transfers from a purchaser's Austrian bank account. 

An eps participating bank will only assume the guarantee for the credit of eps online wire transfers to an account if the status report "OK" is transmitted. The guarantee does not apply to (a) eps online wire transfers which are executed by the Customer after and/or despite the legally valid opening of a bankruptcy or composition proceeding regarding the assets of the Customer; or (b) future payments (scheduled transfers). In addition, there may be time restrictions of availability of the payment guarantee (such as at night or on weekends during maintenance works required by the system). 
In deciding to integrate eps, you understand and accept that eps may impose transaction limits.
