## Direct Debit Request Service Agreement

### Debiting your account

In the event that the net activity in your account on a day is negative, or Stripe needs you to fund your account for any other reason relating to the Stripe Services Agreement, you authorise and request Stripe to debit your Bank Account by using the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS).

Transfers to your Bank Account will come from Stripe (Direct Entry User Number: 452315) and the timing of the transfers will be according to your Payout Schedule. If you’d like details in advance of transfers (both debits and credits), Stripe offers this as a service that you can subscribe to.

### Your responsibilities

It’s your responsibility to:

1. Check whether or not your Bank Account can accept debit and credit transfers through BECS

2. Ensure that your account has sufficient funds to allow for a debit transfer

3. Check your bank statement account details and to verify that all amounts are correct

If transfers are returned to Stripe by your bank, we may charge you a fee according to your Fee Schedule, in addition to any fees your bank may charge. If a debit transfer is returned to Stripe because your Bank Account has insufficient funds, it is your responsibility to fund the Bank Account so that we can re-process the debit transfer.

### Inquiries, Errors, and Disputes

If you believe there has been an error in debiting your account, you should notify us. You can also notify your bank. If there has been an error, we’ll arrange with your bank to adjust your account and we’ll notify you of the amount of the adjustment. If we don’t find an error, we’ll respond to your query with evidence of the correctness of the transfer.

If you’d like to amend this Direct Debit Request Service Agreement or to request that a transfer be deferred or altered, you can do so by emailing us, and we will make the change within 5 business days. You can also request that a transfer be stopped, cancelled, or deferred through your bank.
