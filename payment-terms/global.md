Last updated: January 11, 2017

Payment Terms are terms that apply to the use of Payment Methods. You can decide whether or not to use a Payment Method. However, if you use a Payment Method, you accept and agree to the terms applicable to that Payment Method, which will form part of your agreement with Stripe. 

## Payment Methods

* [Bitcoin](/bitcoin/legal)
* [Apple Pay on the Web](LINK)
* [Amex Checkout](LINK)
* [Giropay](LINK)
* [iDEAL](LINK)
* [SOFORT](LINK)
* [Bancontact](LINK)
* [EPS (E-PAYMENT STANDARD)](LINK)
* [Multibanco](LINK)
* [SEPA Direct Debit](LINK)
* [SEPA Credit Transfers](LINK)

The above list is not an exhaustive list of the Payment Methods offered by Stripe, and there are Payment Methods for which there are no separate Payment Terms.

Payment Method availability also varies by geography. Depending on your location, you may not be able to use one or more of the Payment Methods listed above (or that are otherwise offered by Stripe). The Payment Methods available to you are set out in your Stripe dashboard.

## Amendments and changes

Payment Methods are sourced from various providers, and each provider controls the terms that apply to its Payment Method. As a consequence, the terms and [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs) applicable to a Payment Method are subject to change at any time, and it is your responsibility to periodically review the terms and Documentation in order to ensure that you are aware of, and comply with, the applicable requirements.

Stripe may add or remove Payment Methods at any time. Before doing so, Stripe will provide you with prior notice, except where Stripe is required by a third party (such as the Payment Method provider) to cease offering the payment method.

## Redirection to online banking pages

Some Payment Methods require the re-direction of the Customer to an online banking page (“Online Banking Payment Methods”). If you use an Online Banking Payment Method, you must ensure that the Customer is able to recognize that the re-direction has occurred via the display of the bank’s URL in the address line of the browser, and the Customer must be able to review the security certificate for the bank's online banking page. In addition, you may not use any iframes (or any other method that integrates the online banking page within your site content) when including an Online Banking Payment Method in your payment process.
