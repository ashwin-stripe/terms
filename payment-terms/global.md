# Payment Terms

Payment Terms are terms that apply to the use of Payment Methods. You can decide whether or not to use a Payment Method. However, if you use a Payment Method, you accept and agree to the terms applicable to that Payment Method, which will form part of your agreement with Stripe.

The above list is not an exhaustive list of the Payment Methods offered by Stripe, and there are Payment Methods for which there are no separate Payment Terms.

Payment Method availability also varies by geography. Depending on your location, you may not be able to use one or more of the Payment Methods listed above (or that are otherwise offered by Stripe). The Payment Methods available to you are set out in your Stripe dashboard.

## Amendments and changes

Payment Methods are sourced from various providers, and each provider controls the terms that apply to its Payment Method. As a consequence, the terms and [Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs) applicable to a Payment Method are subject to change at any time, and it is your responsibility to periodically review the terms and Documentation in order to ensure that you are aware of, and comply with, the applicable requirements.

Stripe may add or remove Payment Methods at any time. Before doing so, Stripe will provide you with prior notice, except where Stripe is required by a third party (such as the Payment Method provider) to cease offering the payment method.

## Redirection to online banking pages

Some Payment Methods require the re-direction of the Customer to an online banking page (“Online Banking Payment Methods”). If you use an Online Banking Payment Methods, you must ensure that the Customer is able to recognize that the re-direction has occurred via the display of the bank’s URL in the address line of the browser, and the Customer must be able to review the security certificate for the bank's online banking page.

# SEPA Direct Debit

SEPA Direct Debit (“SDD”) allows you to collect funds from bank accounts at authorised credit institutions located within the Single Euro Payments Area. 

SDD is facilitated by means of a Customer mandate through which the Customer authorizes you to debit his or her account. You may only submit a SDD debit for collection if you have obtained a valid SDD mandate from the Customer. You must ensure that the Customer has accepted the SDD mandate and the information stated in the mandate.

You may only collect SDD debits in compliance with the rules and regulations of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 establishing technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in Euro.

Prior to submitting an SDD debit for collection, you must send a Pre-Notification e-mail to the Customer that sets out the date on which the Customer's account will be debited, the debit amount, the mandate ID (reference number) and creditor identifier.

You are responsible for providing the correct direct debit data. Should a SDD debit be reversed, or should a SDD debit fail due to reasons attributable to you – in particular due to insufficient credit or incorrect account information – you are fully liable to pay the outstanding amount, as well as any applicable reversal fees, any applicable third party fees of the bank holding the account, and any handling fees.

You acknowledge that SDD is not a guaranteed payment method, and there is a risk of failed payments and Disputes. You are not permitted to resubmit the same SDD debit for failed payments or Disputes.

We may at any time request and you will provide evidence of your compliance with the preceding provisions and you will provide all such information without undue delay.

In general, SEPA Credit Transfers are irrevocable. You may request in writing the cancellation of an authorised instruction for a SEPA Credit Transfer, but there is no guarantee that such a request will result in the effective cancellation of a SEPA Credit Transfer or its refund. A processing fee may apply to cancellations.

We may refuse to initiate the execution of a SEPA Credit Transfer payment instruction if your Stripe Account does not contain an adequate balance. A Financial Services Provider may also refuse to execute a SEPA Credit Transfer instruction.
