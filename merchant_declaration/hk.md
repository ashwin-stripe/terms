(D) This Merchant Declaration and Agreement governs how the Stripe Services and the FDMS Services (each a "Service" and collectively, the "Services") are to be provided and to clarify the Parties' rights and obligations under each of the Stripe Services Agreement and the FDMS Agreement with respect to the FDMS Services (each an "Agreement" and collectively, the "Agreements").
